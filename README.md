# Tic
I'm digging into React lately, and I was kinda annoyed with the official tutorial. I think what it came down to is, and this will likely continue, that I'm looking at a problem that I've already solved, and it's being solved in a different way. This is a good thing, this frustration, because will likely lead to some new things.

While I was going through the tutorial, again I was thinking like I have with other tutorials: Where are the tests?, then later: I'm stuck, what did I do wrong (because there's no typescript to help me, and "Why are they doing it this way, it makes it hard to test and easy to break". So, as an exercise, I converted my little react tutorial app over to angular, which is this. I kept as much of the reactish stuff I could, because I wanted to wrap my brain around react more, and to show how I would add tests to this  and refactor for cleaner code. That doesn't mean react is bad, and I would do the same refactors with react. It's also interesting to note that the react version does look cleaner because of the inheirtance, like I had to make up `setState`.
